            Cows often form strong lifelong friendships with one another.
            Sometimes they even choose their best friends the same day they are
            born! When separated from their friends, cows will become stressed.
            Cows help each other and learn from each other.

            Despite popular belief, cows are actually very smart! - They are

      <h1>The Benefits of not eating meat</h1>
      <p>
        You may have heard about the <u>health benefits</u> of eating less meat.
        People who follow plant-based diets low in processed foods and sugar
        tend to have a lower risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, high blood
        pressure, obesity, and certain cancers, such as breast, colorectal, and
        prostate cancer. While these people often have healthier lifestyles in
        other ways, as well‚Äîsuch as getting regular exercise and not
        smoking‚Äîresearch indicates diet plays a significant role in general
        health.
      </p>

      <div class="text-flex">
        <div class="text-one">
          The benefits of not eating meat extend beyond your own body. Animal
          agriculture is extremely destructive to the planet and is the single
          largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. It is also a leading
          cause of land and water use, deforestation, wildlife destruction, and
          species extinction. About 2,000 gallons of water are needed to produce
          just one pound of beef in the U.S. Our oceans are rapidly becoming
          depleted of fish; by some estimates, oceans may be fishless by 2048.
          The current food system, based on meat and dairy production, also
          contributes to world hunger‚Äîthe majority of crops grown worldwide go
          toward feeding livestock, not feeding people.
        </div>
        <div class="text-two">
          Equally important, animals raised for food are sentient beings who
          suffer, whether raised in industrial factory farms or in farms labeled
          ‚Äúhumane.‚Äù Eating a plant-based diet helps us lead a more compassionate
          life. After all, being healthy is not just about the food we eat; its
          also about our consciousness‚Äîour awareness of how our choices affect
          the planet and all of those with whom we share it. So if you're still
          wondering, "Is eating meat bad for you?" The short answer is yes‚Äîfor
          you, and for our entire ecosystem!

            Newborn piglets learn to respond to their mothers‚Äô voices, and
            mother pigs communicate with their babies through grunts and sing to

            Pigs are incredibly social. They form close bonds with each other
            and other animals. To keep warm, pigs may cuddle up with one
            another. Pigs also love to play.
          </li>
          <li>
            In their natural state, pigs are very clean animals. They keep their
            toilets far from their living or feeding areas.
          </li>
          <li>
            They are much more tolerant of colder temperatures than heat. Pigs
            have no sweat glands so they can't sweat. This is why they enjoy
            being in mud to keep themselves cool..

            Chickens demonstrate REM (Rapid Eye Movement) when sleeping. They
            are capable of dreaming, just like us human beings.

            Chickens are able to distinguish between colors. They also see
            ultraviolet light and iridescent hues. Chickens have been found to
            prefer blue objects with red being the next preferred. These two
            colors are then followed by orange and green. The contrast in color
            is very important in attracting chickens to food and water.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chickens have pain receptors, which means that they are able to feel
            pain and suffering.

            They can taste salty, sour and bitter foods but cannot perceive
            sweet tastes. Only 2% of a chicken's taste buds are on their tongue;
            the rest are located at the back of the oral cavity. This means that
            a chicken can only taste what it's eating as it is swallowing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Chickens understand that when an object is taken away and hidden, it
            still exists.

          <li>
            Chickens enjoy a good bath, dust bath that is. They will dig shallow
            pits in the dirt in which they can roll around in the dust and flap
            their wings. They do this to keep bugs and parasites away but also
            to help keep themselves insulated.
          </li>
          <li>
            They make friends! Some bonds are so close that when a chicken dies,
            another may display signs of grief, mourning, and depression..

      <h1>Meatless meals: The benefits of eating less meat</h1>

      <p>
        People decide to eat less meat for many reasons. You may want to cut out
        meat for health, ethical, religious, cultural or environmental reasons.
        But it can be hard to make changes to your diet and still serve healthy
        meals. Why not start by serving meatless meals once or twice a week?
        Meatless meals are built around beans, lentils, vegetables and whole
        grains. Plant-based proteins offer many health benefits. Eating more
        plant-based proteins can help your budget too. They tend to be less
        pricy than meat.
      </p>

      <div class="text-flex">
        <div class="text-one">
          <h2>The health factor</h2>
          A plant-based diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, grains, beans, peas,
          lentils and nuts. It's rich in fiber, vitamins and other nutrients.
          And people who don't eat meat, called vegetarians, generally eat fewer
          calories and less fat. They also tend to weigh less. And they have a
          lower risk of heart disease than nonvegetarians do. Research shows
          that people who eat red meat are at a higher risk of death from heart
          disease, stroke or diabetes. Processed meats also make the risk of
          death from these diseases go up. And what you don't eat also can harm
          your health. Diets low in nuts, seeds, seafood, fruits and vegetables
          can also make your health risks go up. The good news is that even
          eating less red and processed meat has a positive effect on health.

        <div class="text-two">
          <h2>How much protein do you need?</h2>
          Most Americans get enough protein in their diets. The recommended
          daily intake of protein for adults is about 50 grams. Of course, your
          protein needs will vary with age, weight, health, pregnancy, activity
          level and other factors. Adults need about 5 to 7 ounces of
          protein-rich foods a day. And keep in mind, you can choose from more
          than one protein source. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans
          recommends choosing a variety of proteins. These include eggs, low-fat
          milk and products made from it, beans, peas, lentils, soy products,
          and unsalted nuts and seeds. If you're eating a higher calorie protein
          source, stick to smaller portions. For example, enjoy just 1/2 ounce
          of nuts, or 1 to 2 tablespoons of peanut butter. The guidelines also
          suggest replacing protein foods that are higher in solid fats with
          choices that are lower in solid fats and calories. The fats in meat,
          poultry, eggs and high-fat dairy products such as cheese are called
          solid fats. The fats in seafood, nuts and seeds are called oils. Try
          meatless meals once or twice a week You don't have to get rid of all
          meat all at once. Instead, try easing into meatless meals. Think about
          going meatless one day a week. You may find you'll want to add more
          days. If you don't like the idea of a whole day without meat, start
          with a couple of meatless dinners each week. Plan meals that use your
          favorite recipes that are typically meatless, such as lasagna, soup,
          pasta and vegetable salad. Or try substituting the following
          protein-rich foods for meat in your favorite recipes: Beans, peas and
          lentils can be added to casseroles, soups and salads. Vegetarian
          refried beans can be used instead of meat in burritos and tacos. Tofu
          can be added tostir-fry dishes.

            Lambs are less than 12 months old. Adult sheep are 12 months and
            older. Adult females are called ewes.

          <li>
            Lambs can walk just minutes after they are born, though they are

            Sheep have excellent peripheral vision. Their large, rectangular

            Sheep are very gentle animals and were one of the first animals to
            be domesticated.
          </li>
          <li>
            When sheep experience stress or isolation, they show signs of
            depression similar to those that humans show by hanging their heads
            and avoiding positive actions.

          <li>
            Sheep are herbivores, which means their diet does not include meat.
            They typically eat seeds, grass and plants.

          <li>
            Sheep are intelligent, with impressive memory and recognition
